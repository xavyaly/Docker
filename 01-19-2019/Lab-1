Docker Swarm:

Implementation of Docker Swarm
At least 2 Machines required
One will be the Master and another would be the Agent/Workers
To make up and execute the services we have to implement the Docker Swarm Commands
In Master => Fire one command to make it as Master
In Worker => A token would be generated from Master which will going to be fired on Agents/Workers to make it as a Worker
We will have to be execute the token generated from Master and fired on the other servers to work as a worker/Agents.

ELB: Elastic Load Balancing automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets.
In Docker Swarm it uses the default ELB to maintain the balance.

Overlay Network
Bridge Network

Error comes if no Manager Present:
$ docker service update --replicas 5 hello-world
Error response from daemon: This node is not a swarm manager. Use "docker swarm init" or "docker swarm join" to connect this node to swarm and try again.

Notes:
If suppose you have 5 machines then try to create at least two Master and rest of them as Agent/Worker
Else
create at least three as Master/Leader and rest of them as Agent/Worker
