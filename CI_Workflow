The CI workflow described in this document is as follows:

1. Developer pushes a commit to GitHub
2. GitHub uses a webhook to notify Jenkins of the update
3. Jenkins pulls the GitHub repository, including the Dockerfile describing the image, as well as the application and test code.
4. Jenkins builds a Docker image on the Jenkins slave node
5. Jenkins instantiates the Docker container on the slave node, and executes the appropriate tests
6. If the tests are successful the image is then pushed up to Docker Trusted registry
