Another Dockerfile:

ubuntu@ip-172-31-13-237:~$ cat Dockerfile 
# This is a sample image

# BASE IMAGE
FROM ubuntu

MAINTAINER wellboy.alam13@gmail.com

RUN apt-get update 
RUN apt-get install -y nginx 

CMD ["echo","Image successfully created"]
ubuntu@ip-172-31-13-237:~$ 

Save it

Explanation:

The following points need to be noted about the above file −
	The first line "#This is a sample Image" is a comment. You can add comments to the Docker File with the help of the # command 	The next line has to start with the FROM keyword. It tells docker, from which base image you want to base your image from. In our example, we are creating 
	an image from the ubuntu image. 	The next command is the person who is going to maintain this image. Here you specify the MAINTAINER keyword and just mention the email ID. 	The RUN command is used to run instructions against the image. In our case, we first update our Ubuntu system and then install the nginx server on 
	our ubuntu image. 	The last command is used to display a message to the user.
